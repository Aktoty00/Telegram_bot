"""Pumpkin pie with pecan crumble\n
Ingredients:
PASTRY
150 g unsalted butter , (cold), plus extra for greasing
250 g plain flour , plus extra for dusting
50 g icing sugar
1 vanilla pod
1 large free-range egg
semi-skimmed milk
FILLING
1 large butternut squash , (1.5kg)
1 whole nutmeg , for grating
¼ teaspoon ground ginger
¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon
80 g soft brown sugar
2 tablespoons maple syrup
50 g unsalted butter
3 large free-range eggs
CRUMBLE TOPPING
50 g unsalted pecans
30 g unsalted butter , (cold)
50 g plain flour
1 tablespoon soft brown sugar
1 tablespoon maple syrup\n
Method:
1. Preheat the oven to 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6. Lightly grease a deep, 25cm loose-bottomed tart tin.\n
2. To make the pastry, chop the butter into 1cm cubes and place in a food processor with the flour, icing sugar and a good pinch of sea salt.\n
3. Halve the vanilla pod, scrape out the seeds and add to the food processor, then pulse to fine crumbs. Crack in the egg, add a splash of milk, then pulse until it forms a rough dough.\n
4. Pat and bring the dough together into a round, then wrap in clingfilm and pop in the fridge to chill for at least 1 hour.\n
5. For the filling, quarter and deseed the squash, place on a baking tray, then add a generous grating of nutmeg. Sprinkle over the ginger and cinnamon, drizzle with the maple syrup, then cover the tray tightly with a double layer of tin foil and bake 1 hour, or until soft. Leave to cool.\n
6. Reduce the oven temperature to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4.\n
7. On a clean flour-dusted surface, roll out the pastry until it’s around ½cm thick, then loosely roll up around the rolling pin and unroll over the tart tin, easing it in and pushing it carefully into the sides.\n
8. Trim off any excess pastry, patch up any holes, then prick the base with a fork, cover and chill in the fridge for 30 minutes (use any leftover pastry to make a few cheeky mince pies).\n
9. When the time’s up, line the pastry case with quality clingfilm (non-PVC), then fill with rice, making sure you pack it right out to the sides. Bake blind for 10 minutes, remove the clingfilm and rice and bake for a further 10 minutes, or until lightly golden, then leave to cool.\n
10. Scoop the squash flesh and any bits from the tray into the food processor, add the sugar and maple syrup and whiz until smooth.\n
11. Melt the butter and pour into the processor, then crack in the eggs and pulse to combine. Fill the cooled pastry case almost to the top with the mix and bake for 25 minutes.\n
12. Meanwhile, make the topping. Place the pecans into the food processor (give it a quick rinse first) and pulse until roughly chopped\n
13. Add the butter, flour, sugar and maple syrup, then pulse to a rough crumb.\n
14. When the time’s up, remove the tart from the oven, sprinkle over the topping, then bake for a further 20 minutes, or until golden. Leave to cool before slicing.\n
15. Delicious served with a dollop of boozy cream. I sometimes like to decorate my pie with extra toasted pecans, just before serving, too.\n

"""Blackcurrant ombré cheesecake\n
Ingredients:
100 g unsalted butter , plus extra for greasing
300 g oaty biscuits
1 vanilla pod
500 g light cream cheese
300 ml double cream
1½ x 340 g jars of Tiptree blackcurrant jam
4 sheets of gelatine
200 g blackcurrants and blackberries , plus extra to decorate\n
Method:
1. Grease the sides of a 23cm loose-bottomed cake tin and line the base with greaseproof paper.\n
2. In a large saucepan, melt the butter over a low heat. Blitz the biscuits in a food processor until finely ground, then stir into the butter. Press the crumbs evenly into the tin, then leave in the fridge for 20 minutes to firm up.\n
3. Halve the vanilla pod lengthways, scrape the seeds into a large bowl and whisk in the cream cheese.\n
4. In a separate bowl, whisk the cream to soft peaks, then fold into the cream cheese with 1 heaped teaspoon of jam. Spoon a 1cm-thick layer over the biscuit base.\n
5. Add 1 heaped tablespoon of jam to the rest of the mixture, and add another layer to the cheesecake. Keep doing this, adding more jam each time – so the layers get darker as you go – until you have used a whole jar of jam, leaving a 1cm gap at the top. Place the cheesecake in the fridge for 1 hour to firm up.\n
6. Meanwhile, make the jelly. Soak the gelatine in cold water for 5 minutes, then drain. Spoon the remaining ½ jar of jam in a saucepan over a low heat along with 100ml of water and 50g of berries, and gently simmer for 3 minutes.\n
7. Stir in the gelatine until dissolved, then pour into a glass jug and cool for 30 minutes.\n
8. Once cooled, pour the jelly over the cheesecake, carefully spreading over the surface. Let it sit in the fridge for 1 more hour, until the jelly is firm to the touch.\n
9. The cheesecake will keep in the fridge for up to 3 days – serve garnished with the remaining blackcurrants and blackberries.""",

"""Almond pastry puff\n
Ingredients:
100 g blanched almonds
1 tablespoon double cream , plus extra to serve
75 g icing sugar , plus extra for dusting
2 large free-range eggs
375 g block of all-butter puff pastry , (cold)\n
Method:
1. Preheat the oven to 220°C/425°F/gas 7. Line a baking tray with greaseproof paper.\n
2. Blitz the almonds in a food processor until nice and fine. With the processor still running, add the cream, icing sugar, 1 egg and a pinch of sea salt until combined, stopping to scrape down the sides with a spatula, if needed.\n
3. Halve the pastry, shape into two rounds and, working quickly, dusting with icing sugar as you go to stop the pastry sticking, roll out between two sheets of greaseproof paper until they’re just under ½cm thick.\n
4. Place one round on the lined tray. Spread the almond paste on top, leaving a 2cm gap at the edges. Put the other round on top and gently push together. Quickly seal the edges with the back of a fork. Eggwash the top, then dust over an extra layer of sugar.\n
5. Gently push your finger into the middle of the pastry, then, with a sharp knife, very delicately make little lines from the centre to the outside.\n
6. Bake on the bottom of the oven for 12 to 15 minutes, or until puffed up and golden, dusting with a little extra icing sugar before dishing up.""",

"""Brigadeiros\n
Ingredients:
400 g condensed milk
4 tablespoons cocoa powder
¼ teaspoon sea salt
3 tablespoons butter
1 vanilla pod
good-quality chocolate sprinkles , for coating\n
Method:
1. Pour the condensed milk into a heavy-based saucepan and sift in the cocoa powder and ¼ of a teaspoon of sea salt.\n
2. Place over a low heat and cook for 10 to 15 minutes, stirring, until the mixture is thick, shiny and leaves the  sides of the pan when stirred. Do not leave the pan unattended, as the condensed milk can burn easily.\n
3. Once the chocolate mixture has thickened, remove from the heat and stir in the butter.\n
4. Split the vanilla pod in half lengthways and scrape out the seeds with the back of a small knife. Add the seeds to the pan and stir well. (The scraped-out pod can be used to make vanilla sugar – just put it in your sugar jar and leave it to infuse the sugar).\n
5. Let the mixture cool completely, then cover with clingfilm and chill for about 30 minutes, until set.\n
6. Put the chocolate sprinkles in a small bowl. If you have one, use a mini ice-cream scoop to make a 20g ball and drop it into the sprinkles (alternatively, use a teaspoon).\n
7. Coat it liberally with the sprinkles, roll it with your hands to make a neat ball and place it in a mini cupcake or petit-four case. Continue with the rest of the mixture.\n
8. Store in an airtight container in the fridge, but take them out at least half an hour before serving, as they’re best at room temperature.\n

½ teaspoon vanilla extract
½ teaspoon baking powder
250 g quality dark chocolate , (70%)
100 g icing sugar
300 g desiccated coconut
1 x 340 g jar of quality raspberry jam\n
