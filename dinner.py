"""Pot-roast beef\n
Ingredients:
1kg silverside or topside of beef, with no added fat
2 tbsp olive oil
8 young carrots tops trimmed (but leave a little, if you like)
1 celery stick, finely chopped
200ml white wine
600ml rich beef stock
2 bay leaves
500g onion
1 tsp butter
1 tsp light brown or light muscovado sugar
2 tsp plain flour\n
Method:
1. Heat oven to 160C/140C fan/gas 3. Rub the meat with 1 tsp of the oil and plenty of seasoning. Heat a large flameproof casserole dish and brown the meat all over for about 10 mins. 
Meanwhile, add 2 tsp oil to a frying pan and fry the carrots and celery for 10 mins until turning golden.\n
2. Lift the beef onto a plate, splash the wine into the hot casserole and boil for 2 mins. Pour in the stock, return the beef, then tuck in the carrots, celery and bay leaves, trying 
not to submerge the carrots too much. Cover and cook in the oven for 2 hrs. (I like to turn the beef halfway through cooking.)
Meanwhile, thinly slice the onions. Heat 1 tbsp oil in a pan and stir in the onions, thyme and some seasoning. Cover and cook gently for 20 mins until the onions are softened but 
not coloured. Remove the lid, turn up the heat, add the butter and sugar, then let the onions caramelise to a dark golden brown, stirring often. Remove the thyme sprigs, then set 
aside.\n
When the beef is ready, it will be tender and easy to pull apart at the edges. Remove it from the casserole and snip off the strings. Reheat the onion pan, stir in the flour and 
cook for 1 min. Whisk the floury onions into the beefy juices in the casserole, to make a thick onion gravy. Taste for seasoning. Add the beef and carrots back to the casserole, 
or slice the beef and bring to the table on a platter, with the carrots to the side and the gravy spooned over.""",

 """Super tasty Spanish roast chicken\n
Ingredients:
1.6 kg potatoes , peeled and cut into 2.5cm dice
4 lemons
1 handful fresh flat-leaf parsley
2 kg higher-welfare chicken
sea salt
freshly ground black pepper
300 g iberico chorizo sausage
olive oil
2 cloves garlic , peeled and finely chopped\n
Method:
1. First preheat your oven to 220ºC/425ºF/gas 7, then place your potatoes with 2 of your lemons into a small pan of water and boil for 5 minutes. Drain, and then prick the lemons all over with a knife. (The reason for doing this is that you are going to put them inside the chicken and their wonderful juices will be released while cooking. They will burst with flavour and fragrance, and the heat from the lemons will help the chicken to cook quicker from the inside as well as making it taste and smell amazing.) Remove the parsley leaves from the stalks and put to one side. Stuff the chicken with your hot lemons and the parsley stalks. Then season the chicken and the potatoes with a tiny pinch of salt and freshly ground black pepper, and slice your chorizo at an angle, 0.5cm/¼ inch thick.\n
2. Get yourself an appropriately sized baking tray. Take a piece of greaseproof paper and wet it under a tap so it becomes flexible, then shake it out and lay it into the baking tray. Place the potatoes into the centre of the greaseproof paper, then place the chicken on top and sprinkle with the chorizo and a little of your chopped parsley. Drizzle with a little olive oil. Cook in the preheated oven for around 1 hour 20 minutes.\n
3. While the chicken and potatoes are cooking you can make what the Italians call gremolata, by finely chopping the zest of your 2 remaining lemons and mixing it with the chopped parsley and garlic. Season with a little pinch of salt and freshly ground black pepper and toss together to create a really fragrant seasoning-type garnish. Remove the tray from the oven, take the chicken out and put to one side to rest. Give the potatoes a shake about and put them back in the oven for a few minutes to crisp up.\n
4. Carve the chicken and divide between 8 plates, with the potatoes. The potatoes will have taken on the smoky paprika flavour from the chorizo, so if there is any juice left over in the tray, pour every last drop over the plates. When you sprinkle over the gremolata it will hit the hot juice and smell fantastic. You're going to love this one! A rocket salad goes really well with it.\n

 """The nicest tray-baked lemon sole:\n
Ingredients:
1 bunch spring onions , trimmed and finely sliced
1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
sea salt
freshly ground black pepper
2 lemons , zest of, halved
extra virgin olive oil
1 handful black olives , destoned and chopped
1 handful fresh flat-leaf parsley , finely chopped
4 whole lemon soles , from sustainable sources, ask your fishmonger
2 handfuls red and yellow cherry tomatoes , halved
4 cloves garlic , peeled and finely sliced
1 handful fresh oregano or basil , leaves picked\n
Method:
1. This is really simple. First of all give your fish a wash, then with a sharp knife score across each fish down to the bone at 2.5cm/1 inch intervals on both sides. This allows flavour to penetrate the fish and lets the fish’s juices come out.\n
2. Preheat the oven to 200ºC/400ºF/gas 6. Get yourself a bowl and add the tomatoes, garlic, oregano or basil, spring onions, balsamic vinegar, a pinch of salt and pepper and the zest and juice of 1 lemon to it. Loosen with a couple of good tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil and mix well, then spread over the bottom of a large roasting tray. Use one that will fit all 4 fish quite snugly (or you can use two smaller trays). Place the fish on top – top to tail.\n
3. Now add the olives, parsley, juice and zest of the second lemon to the bowl that the tomatoes were in. Loosen with a little olive oil and then divide this mixture between the fish, placing an equal amount on the centre of each. Cook in the preheated oven for 12 to 15 minutes, depending on the size of the fish. To check whether they’re done, take the tip of a knife and push it into the thickest part of the fish. When done, the flesh will easily pull away from the bone.\n
4. Once cooked, remove the fish from the oven and allow them to rest for 3 or 4 minutes while you get your guests round the table, serve them some wine and dress your salad. Then you can come back to the fish. Divide them up at the table on to 4 plates, making sure that everyone gets some tomatoes and juice spooned over the top of the fish. Lovely!\n
