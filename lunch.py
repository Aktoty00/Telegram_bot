Ingredients:
2 tbsp vegetable oil
1 eggbeaten with about 2 tbsp water
1 onionchopped
2 garlic cloves, crushed
1 heaped tbsp curry powder
2 tbsp tomato ketchup
a large handful of frozen peas(about 85g/3oz)

1. Heat half the oil in a large non-stick frying pan over a highish heat. Pour in the beaten egg, swoosh it around the pan and leave it to set for a minute. Flip it over like a pancake and let it cook for a minute more on the otherside, then tip it out flat on to a plate.\n
2. Heat the remaining oil in the same pan. Tip in the onion and sizzle for 3-4 minutes until it’s starting to brown, then stir in the garlic, curry powder and ketchup. Add the peas and 
cook for a minute or two until they start to defrost. Tip in the rice, cooked meat and a glass of water (100ml/31⁄2fl oz) and cook over a medium heat for 5-6 minutes, stirring as you 
go, until everything’s piping hot and the rice has taken on the colour of the curry powder.\n
3. While your rice is frying, shred the omelette into long strips. Toss the omelette and soy sauce through the rice and cook for a moment more. Scoop the rice on to plates straight from 
the pan and serve with extra soy sauce for sprinkling over."""
